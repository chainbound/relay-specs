  description: |
    * This endpoint allows fetching a stream of constraints from the relay.
    
    * The response is a stream of signed constraints, including messages and signatures.
    
    * The `backfill` parameter can be used to opt into backfilling constraints.
    
    * The headers `Content-Type` should be `text/event-stream` and `Connection` should be `keep-alive`.
